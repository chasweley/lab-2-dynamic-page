                        Hi, my name is Charlotte. I am currently studying full stack development
                        with focus on .NET at Chas Academy. I really love problem solving and am a
                        logic thinker, that is why I think coding suits me well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have studied behavioral science and have a bachelors degree in
                        psychology. That together with my work experience has made me able to work
                        with lots of different people in various situations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of work I like to read, listen to music, go to metal and classical
                        concerts and working out at the gym.
                    </p>
